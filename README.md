# New approaches of integrated gradients

## General overview

Integrated Gradients (a.k.a IG) is a state-of-the-art Explainable AI technique which is exposed in this [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01365.pdf). The main goal of this specific technique is to explain the relationship between a model's predictions and its features.

Nevertheless, IG depends on a baseline, which in itself is a major disadvantage of the technique, as it makes it dependent on human judgment. 

Therefore, this repo includes code that is used to research ways to improve this specific Explainable AI technique, and create a new algorithm that reduces or eliminates many of the drawbacks of IG.

## How to run locally

1. Install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```
    Further Jupyter-related documentation can be found in the [Jupyter page](https://jupyter.org/install).

2. Clone this repo using this command:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:SantiagoCalderon1999/Integrated-Gradients.git
    ```
3. Open Jupyter notebook by making use of this command:
    ```
    jupyter-lab
    ```
4. Explore each one of the folders and modify it to your liking :)
